I Wish To Be a Sailor </span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">MY name is Robinson Crusoe. I was born in the old city of York, where there is a broad river, with ships coming and going.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I was a little boy, I spent much of my time looking at the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How pleasant was the quiet stream, flowing, always flowing, toward the far-away sea!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 244.68px; height: 238.29px;"><img alt="" src="/images/image17.gif" style="width: 244.68px; height: 238.29px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I liked to watch the ships as they came in with their white sails spread to the wind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I liked to think of the strange lands which they must have visited, and of the many wonderful things they must have passed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wished to be a sailor. I thought how grand it must be to sail and sail on the wide blue sea, with the sky above and the waves beneath. Nothing could be pleasanter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My father wanted me to learn a trade. But I could not bear the thought of it. I could not bear the thought of working every day in a dusty shop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did not wish to stay in York all my life. I wanted to see the world. I would be a sailor and nothing else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My mother was very sad when I told her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A sailor&#39;s life, she said, was a hard life. There were many storms at sea, and ships were often wrecked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She told me, too, that there were great fishes in the sea, and that they would eat me up if I fell into the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then she gave me a cake, and kissed me. &quot;How much safer it is to be at home!&quot; she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I would not listen to her. My mind was made up, and a sailor I would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I was eighteen years old, I left my pleasant home and went to sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 1:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Sailor -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Voyage -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Trade -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.hnv3ltwwtj1b"><span class="c14">2.

A sailor&#39;s life is indeed a hard life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no time for play on board of our ship. Even in the fairest weather there was much work to be done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the very first night the wind began to blow. The waves rolled high. The ship was tossed this way and that. Never had I seen such a storm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All night long the wind blew. I was so badly frightened that I did not know what to do. I thought the ship would surely go to the bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 395.00px; height: 255.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image39.gif" style="width: 395.00px; height: 255.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I remembered my pleasant home and the words of my kind mother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;If I live to reach dry land,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;I will give up this thought of being a sailor. I will go home and stay with my father and mother. I will never set foot in another ship.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Day came. The storm was worse than before. I felt sure that we were lost. But toward evening the sky began to clear. The wind died away. The waves went down. The storm was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next morning the sun rose bright and warm upon a smooth sea. It was a beautiful sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I stood looking out over the wide water, the first mate came up. He was a kind man, and always friendly to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, Bob,&quot; he said, &quot;how do you like it? Were you frightened by that little gale?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I hope you don&#39;t call it a little gale,&quot; I said. &quot;Indeed it was a terrible storm.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The mate laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you call that a storm?&quot; he asked. &quot;Why, it was nothing at all. You are only a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Wait till we have a real storm.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so I soon forgot my fears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Little by little, I gave up all thoughts of going home again. &quot;A sailor&#39;s life for me,&quot; I said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My first voyage was not a long one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I visited no new lands, for the ship went only to London. But the things which I saw in that great city seemed very wonderful to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nothing would satisfy me but to make a long voyage. I wished to see the whole world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 2:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Satisfy -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Gale -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Frightened -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.uucuyi6lta88"><span class="c20">3. I See Much of the World</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">IT was easy to find a ship to my liking; for all kinds of trading vessels go out from London to every country that is known.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day I met an old sea captain who had been often to the coast of Africa. He was pleased with my talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;If you want to see the world,&quot; he said, &quot;you must sail with me.&quot; And then he told me that he was going again to Africa, to trade with the black people there. He would carry out a load of cheap trinkets to exchange for gold dust and feathers and other rare and curious things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was very glad to go with him. I would see strange lands and savage people. I would have many stirring adventures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before ten days had passed, we were out on the great ocean. Our ship was headed toward the south.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The captain was very kind to me. He taught me much that every sailor ought to know. He showed me how to steer and manage the vessel. He told me about the tides and the compass and how to reckon the ship&#39;s course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The voyage was a pleasant one, and I saw more wonderful things than I can name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When, at last, we sailed back to London, we had gold enough to make a poor man rich.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had nearly six pounds of the yellow dust for my own share.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had learned to be a trader as well as a sailor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would take too long to tell you of all my voyages. Some of them were happy and successful; but the most were unpleasant and full of disappointment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sometimes I went to Africa, sometimes to the new land of South America. But wherever I sailed I found the life of a sailor by no means easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did not care so much now to see strange sights and visit unknown shores.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I cared more for the money or goods that I would get by trading.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last a sudden end was put to all my sailing. And it is of this that I will now tell you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 3:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Adventure -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Trading -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Savage -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.5c2k2jqbeaji"><span class="c15">4. I Undertake a New Venture</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I HAD grown very tired of being a sailor. I was so tired of it that I made up my mind to try something else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It happened that I was then in Brazil. I bought some land there and began to open a plantation. The ground was rich, and it would be easy to raise tobacco and sugar cane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I needed many things. I must have plows and hoes and a sugar mill. Above all I must have men to do the work on the plantation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But neither men nor tools could I get in Brazil.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I sent to London for the tools. I tried to buy some slaves of the planters near me, but they had not enough for themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;We will tell you what to do,&quot; they said. &quot;We will fit out a trading vessel for Africa. We will put aboard of it everything that you need. As for your part, you shall be the manager of the business; and you shall do the trading for us. You need not put in a penny of your own.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 281.00px; height: 261.66px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.gif" style="width: 281.00px; height: 261.66px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;But how is that going to help me?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Listen, and we will tell you,&quot; they said. &quot;With the goods which we send, you will buy as many black slaves as the ship will hold. You will bring them here, and we will divide them equally. You shall share with us, just as though you had paid the money.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The plan pleased me very much. I figured that each one of us would have thirty or forty slaves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was very foolish of me to go to sea again; but the offer was so good that I could not say No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ship was soon fitted out for the voyage. Her load was not very heavy. But there were plenty of goods that were most fit for trade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were boxes of red and blue beads, of bits of glass, and of other trinkets.

But the water was smooth, the tide was flowing in, and a gentle wind was blowing toward the land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I loosed the rope that held the raft to the ship, and soon began my little voyage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tide was now so high that the dry land was much farther away than when I came out. But the raft floated smoothly along, and drew nearer and nearer to the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as I thought myself safe, I found that I was entering a strong current which carried me into a narrow bay far from my first landing place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There the raft stuck fast on an ugly sandbar, and was like to be tipped over. It was all I could do to keep the heavy boxes from slipping off into the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the tide was still rising. Soon the raft floated free and glided slowly along again with the current.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a short time I found that I was being carried up into a little river with high banks on each side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a piece of plank for an oar I pushed the raft toward the shore on my right. The water was now so shallow that I could reach the bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The raft floated slowly onward until it reached a little cove into which I pushed it. The water there was quite still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked around for a place to land. But the banks were steep, and if I ran one end of my raft upon the shore, the other end might sink so low as to slide all my goods into the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The best I could do was to wait till the tide was at its highest. Then I might push a little farther inland where the bank was somewhat lower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tide rose higher and higher. At last, to my joy, the water reached the top of the bank. It covered a level spot of ground beyond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I waited a little longer. The water on the level space was a foot deep. The tide was beginning to flow out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With all my might I pushed the raft into this shallow place. The tide ebbed fast. Soon the raft was left high and dry on the land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 412.00px; height: 434.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image42.gif" style="width: 412.00px; height: 434.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was easy now to unload the goods and carry them to a safe place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 10:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Goods -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Powder -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Voyage -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.s42lchps7yth"><span class="c14">11. I Learn That I Am on an Island</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">THE sun was still two hours high. I was very tired after my day&#39;s work, but I could not rest. I wanted to know what sort of place I was in. I wondered whether I was on an island or on a continent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">About half a mile from the shore there was a large hill. It was steep and high and seemed to overlook all the country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought that if I could get to the top of that hill I might see what kind of country I was in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I put one of the pistols in my belt, and one of the guns on my shoulder. I also hung the powder-horn from my neck and put a handful of small shot in my pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus armed, I set out for the big hill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were but a few shrubs or trees in my way, and the walking was easy. In less than a quarter of an hour I was at my journey&#39;s end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sides of the hill were not rough, but they were quite steep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon I was at the very top. What a grand lookout it was!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">North, south, east, west, the land and the sea were spread out before me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sea did I say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes, I was on an island, and the sea was all around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No other land was in sight except two small islands and some great rocks that lifted themselves out of the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw that my island was not very large. Perhaps it was ten miles broad; perhaps it was twenty. I had no good idea of distances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no house nor sign of life anywhere. There might be wild beasts in the woods; but I was sure that no men lived there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The thought of being alone on a desert island made me feel very sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I should have been glad at that moment to see even the face of a savage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I dared not stay long on the hilltop. I hurried to get back to my raft before the sun should go down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the foot of the hill I saw a great bird sitting in a tree. I thought it to be some kind of a hawk and shot it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 11:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Dared -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Shrubs -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Explore -</span></p><h2 class="c11 c19" id="h.z3juzvhnbh"><span class="c1"></span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_03_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246755916943&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zWny2vyzI_TIZu5Fo5kDw">12-15</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.83m5kjfbe9xx"><span class="c14">12. I Have a Strange Visitor</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">THE next morning, when the tide was at its lowest I swam out to the ship again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were still many things on board of it that might be useful to me in my island home. I wished to save all that I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I climbed up the ship&#39;s side just as I had done the day before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before looking for anything I made another raft, just like the first one, but smaller. It was not so easy to make, for I had used up all the best planks. It was neither so large nor so strong as the first raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the carpenter&#39;s shop I found three bags of nails and a grindstone. I found also a box full of little hatchets and a small barrel of musket balls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the captain&#39;s room I found six or seven guns, which I had overlooked before, and another keg of powder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All these things I loaded with much care upon my raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I gathered up as many clothes as I could find; also a spare sail, a hammock, and some bedding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The raft was now quite full. The things were not heavy, but they made a large pile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the tide turned for the shore, I cut loose and was soon floating homeward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had found a good oar in the ship. This I used as a paddle, and I had no trouble in guiding the raft to the right landing place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked to see if the goods which I brought over the day before were safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There, on one of my chests, I saw a strange animal sitting. She looked like a wild cat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I went toward her, she jumped down and ran a little way. Then she stood still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I followed. She stood very firm and looked in my face. She looked as though she had a mind to get acquainted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I pointed my gun at her, and shouted. But she did not care for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had a bit of biscuit in my pocket. This I now tossed toward her. &quot;Take this and begone,&quot; I shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Biscuits were not so many that I could well spare any. But I spared the poor animal this little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It rolled quite close to her nose. She smelled it and ate it. Then she looked up for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you, I have no more to give you,&quot; I said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether she understood me, I do not know.

It was no easy task, and I had to make many trips to and from the raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When everything was safely landed, I made me a little tent with the sail and some poles that I cut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I put everything into the tent that needed to be kept dry. The empty boxes, I piled outside. They made a kind of wall around the tent, like the wall of a fort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;This will keep the wild beasts out,&quot; I said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By this time the day was nearly done. I spread one of the beds on the ground. I laid two loaded pistols near its head, and one of the guns by one side of it.

This I kept up for more than a week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Every day I brought a load of things to the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last there was nothing left that one pair of hands could lift.

I would have cut it into pieces and brought one piece at a time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The last thing that I found was a secret drawer in the cabin.

I must build me a little fort or castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The place I was in was flat and wet. My tent was on open ground and could be plainly seen from a distance.

I went to look at it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Halfway up the hill there was a large level place, with a great rock rising behind it like the side of a house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I climbed up to the level place. There was but one way to go, and that was by a steep and winding path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found the place much larger than I thought. It was more than a hundred yards long and almost half as broad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was, indeed, a green field, or plain, with a steep cliff rising up behind it. You must think of it as a great shelf half way up the side of the hill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Here,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;is the place for my castle.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was no easy thing to carry all my goods up the steep path to this level plain. I worked hard for many days; but, then, there was nothing else to do, and I needed to keep busy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At one place on the side of the great rock there was a break, or opening, like the door to a cave. But there was no cave there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just in front of this break I began to build my castle. First, I drew a half circle upon the ground, with the opening at the center. The space which it enclosed was about thirty feet across.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In this half circle I set up two rows of strong stakes, driving them deep into the ground.</span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 313.65px; height: 238.05px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.gif" style="width: 313.65px; height: 238.05px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rows were not more than six inches apart. The stakes were about two inches apart and as high as my head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then between and around these stakes I laid the great ropes that I had brought from the ship. Among these I twined the slender branches of trees and long grapevines that I found in the woods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When all was finished I had a wall nearly six feet high. It was so strong that nothing could break through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I made no door in the wall. The only way in which to get into the yard behind it was by going over the top. This was done by climbing a short ladder which I could lift up after me, and then let down again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How safe I felt now, as I stood inside of my castle wall!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Over this wall I next carried all my riches, food, my tools, my boxes of clothing. Then, right against the great rock, I made me a large tent to shelter me from the rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Into this tent I brought everything that would be spoiled by getting wet. In the middle of it I swung the hammock that I had brought from the ship.

I will name them now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First I got from the captain&#39;s desk some pens, ink, and paper.

These I threw in a corner, for I did not think I should ever need them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Among my own things there were three very old Bibles, which I had bought in England and had packed with my clothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And I must not forget the dog and two cats that came to shore with me. I carried both the cats on my raft with my first cargo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for the dog, he jumped off the wreck and swam to the shore. He was my best friend for a long time. He followed me everywhere. He would run and fetch things for me as I bade him. I wanted him to talk to me, but he could not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for my pens, ink, and paper, I took the greatest care of them. As long as my ink lasted, I wrote down everything that happened to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But when that was gone, I could write no more for I did not know how to make ink.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I soon found that I needed many things to make me comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First, I wanted a chair and a table; for without them I must live like a savage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I set to work.

The noise was the most frightful I ever heard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were three shocks about eight minutes apart. The strongest building you ever saw would have been overturned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was so frightened that I did not know what to do.

Dark clouds rolled over the sea. The wind began to blow. A dreadful hurricane was at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sea was covered with foam. The waves were mountain high.

I feared now lest some wild beast might get into my house; and yet the biggest animal I had seen on the island was a goat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon after this I put a roof over my whole enclosure. I took a number of long poles for rafters and laid one end of each on the wall, while the other end leaned against the rock above the cave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These I covered with boughs of trees, long grass, and such other things as I could get. In this way I made a very good roof which turned the rain and kept everything dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My castle was now a very roomy place. It was quite warm and dry even in the worst of weather.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 19:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Enclosure -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Bower -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Boughs -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_05_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246755941690&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FuzK_OfzEcJnLqJYCrz5T">20-23</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.8kj7pmmiqshg"><span class="c14">20.

I will tell you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A few days after the shipwreck it came into my mind that I should lose track of the days and the seasons. For I had neither almanac nor notebook. It would be hard always to remember the days of the week and I might even forget when it was Sunday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I set up a large post by my door.

I knew, therefore, that it was just one year since my landing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I kept this day as a solemn fast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I sat in my castle and thought of the goodness of God in thus keeping me alive and safe in the midst of so many perils</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I humbled myself, and thanked him for his many mercies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For twelve hours I tasted nothing.

I saw nothing there but some dust and chaff. The rats had been there, and had eaten the grains of barley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The bag would be useful for something else. I took it outside and shook the dust and chaff upon the ground. It was a sunny place, close by the great rock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 284.00px; height: 424.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image37.gif" style="width: 284.00px; height: 424.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">About a month after this, I saw that something green was starting to grow at that place. I wondered what it was. It could not be grass, for the stalks were larger and stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had forgotten about the barley. But I took care that nothing should break the stalks down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They grew fast, and were soon as high as my waist. Then I was surprised to see ten or twelve heads of green barley come out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You cannot think how glad I was. I remembered, then, how I had shaken the bag of dust and chaff over that very spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But there was another surprise for me. I noticed in the wet ground a little nearer the rock some other green plants. These were not so tall as the barley stalks, and they did not seem to be the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I watched them for several days. Then I saw that they were stalks of rice. No doubt some grains of rice had been in the bag with the barley, and had fallen out with the dust and chaff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You may be sure that I took good care of the grain. As soon as the barley was ripe I harvested it. There was only a handful or two; but I put it away where no rats could get to it. I wished to keep it safe and plant it again the next season.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did the same thing with the rice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was so little to begin with that it took a long time to grow a big crop. It was not until the fourth harvest that I could keep some of the barley for bread.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found that the best place to plant the grain was not on the hillside, but in a moist spot not far from my summer home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day, as soon as the wet season was at an end, I made a visit to the country to see how my crops were growing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There I saw something that surprised me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You will remember the fence that I built around my summer house, or bower as I called it. It was made of two rows of tall stakes, with brush between.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Well, I now found that the stakes were still green, and that long shoots or twigs were growing from them. Some of these branches were already two or three feet long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This pleased me very much. I cut and trained the growing branches into just such shapes as I wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They grew very fast, and soon the whole fence was covered with green leaves. Then I trained the long branches toward the top of a pole which I set up in the center of my bower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a few months the whole enclosure was covered with a green roof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You cannot think how beautiful it was. The place was shady and cool, the pleasantest spot one could wish to have.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did not know what kind of tree it was that grew in this wonderful way. But I cut some more stakes of the same sort and carried them home to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I set these stakes in a double row, about twenty inches outside of my first wall. In a few weeks they began to grow. They grew so fast that in two years they covered the whole space in front of my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were not only handsome to look at, but they helped to protect my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 21:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Grain -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Barley -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Harvest -</span></p><h2 class="c11 c19" id="h.4xrolmlv1u7k"><span class="c14"></span></h2><h2 class="c11" id="h.ylm0y3z9428r"><span class="c14">22. I Make a Long Journey</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I HAD long wished to see the whole of my island. So, one fine morning, I set out to travel across to the other side of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course I carried my gun with me. In my belt was my best hatchet. In my pouch I had plenty of powder and shot. In my pocket were two biscuits and a big bunch of raisins. My dog followed behind me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went past my summer house, or bower, and toward evening came to a fine open place close by the sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a beautiful sight. The sky was clear, the air was still. The smooth waters stretched away and away toward the setting sun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Far in the distance I could see land. I could not tell whether it was an island or some part of the mainland of America. It was at least fifty miles away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If it were the mainland, I felt quite sure that I would at some time or other see a ship sailing hither to it or from it. If it were an island, there might be savages on it whom it would not be safe for me to meet. But it would do no good to worry my mind about such matters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found this side of the island much more beautiful than that where my castle was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here were large, open fields, green with grass and sweet with flowers. Here, too, were fine woods, with many strange trees and vines.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw many green parrots among the trees, and I thought how I would catch one and teach it to talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After a great deal of trouble I knocked a young one down with my stick. He was a good fighter, and it was no easy matter to get him. But at last I picked him up and put him in my bag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 361.00px; height: 224.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image18.gif" style="width: 361.00px; height: 224.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was not hurt, and I carried him home. It was a long time before I could make him talk. But at last he became a great pet and would call me by my name. I shall have a funny story to tell about him after a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides parrots there were many other birds in the woods. Some of these were of kinds that I had never seen before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the low grounds I saw some animals that looked like rabbits. There were others that I took to be foxes, but they were not such foxes as we have in England.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I traveled very slowly around the island, for I wished to see everything. Often I did not go more than two miles in a day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At night I sometimes slept in a tree, while my dog watched below me. Sometimes I shut myself up in a little pen made by driving tall stakes into the ground. I felt quite safe, for nothing could come near me without waking me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Along the seashore there were thousands of turtles and a great plenty of waterfowl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had no trouble finding all the food I needed. Sometimes I had a roast pigeon for dinner, sometimes the juicy meat of a turtle, sometimes that of a goat. No king could have fared better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day my dog caught a young kid. I ran and got hold of it, and would not let him hurt it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had a great mind to take it home with me. So I made a collar for it, and led it along by a string which I had in my pocket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was quite wild and did not lead well. It gave me so much trouble that I took it to my summer house and left it there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I then went home to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 22:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Journey -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Parrot -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Valley -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.oq21oyze5yaj"><span class="c14">23.

He was very gentle for a parrot, and soon became very fond of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I began to think of the kid that I had left in my summer bower. So I went with my dog to fetch it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found it where I had left it. It had eaten all the grass inside of the fence and was now very hungry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave it as much as it wished, and then I tied the string to it to lead it away. But there was no need for that, for it was quite tame.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It followed me everywhere. It was very gentle and loving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had now a number of pets and was no longer lonesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My life was much happier than it had been while I was sailing the seas. I took delight in many things that I had never cared for before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My barley and rice had grown well and in another month would be ready to be harvested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But one day I saw that some animals had been in the field. Goats and rabbits had trampled upon the green stalks and had eaten the long blades of barley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If things kept on this way I would soon lose my grain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was nothing to be done but to build a fence or hedge around the field. This was easy, for the field was not large.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I drove tall stakes into the ground all around my growing crops. These stakes were so close together that not even a rabbit could get between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I tied my dog near the gate of the little field, so that he would bark whenever any animal came near.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My grain was now safe from the beasts. It grew fast. The barley sent out large heads which soon began to ripen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now the birds came down in great flocks to rob me. They sat on the fence, they flew among the stalks of grain, they carried away all the ripe barley they could find.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This troubled me very much. Most of the grain was still green. But I feared that as soon as it ripened I should lose it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I loaded my gun and went out to the field. There I saw the thieves, sitting on the fence and watching me. I was so angry that I fired right among them and killed three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 362.00px; height: 396.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image27.gif" style="width: 362.00px; height: 396.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Now I will show you how to steal my grain!&quot; I cried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I put up a long pole in the center of the field, and on top of it I hung the three dead birds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;This will I do to all that venture to come into my field,&quot; I said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Strange to say, this ended all my troubles.

I had neither scythe nor sickle to cut it down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But you will member that I had two old swords which I had found in the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With one of the swords I cut off the heads of the barley and dropped them into a big basket I had made. I carried these heads into my cave and thrashed out the grain with my hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When all my harvesting was done, I measured the grain. I had two bushels of rice and two bushels and a half of barley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This pleased me very much. I felt now that I should soon be able to raise grain enough for food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Have you ever thought how many things are necessary for the making of your bread?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You have nothing to do but eat the bread after others have made it. But I had to sow, to reap, to thrash, to grind, to sift, to mix, and to bake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To do all these I needed many tools.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had no plow to turn up the ground. I had no spade nor shovel with which to dig it. But with great labor I made me a wooden spade, which was better than nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the ground was turned up, I sowed the seed by scattering it with my hands. But it must be covered so it would grow, and I had no harrow. I cut down the branch of a tree, and dragged it over the field. This, I think, was the way that people in old times harrowed their ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 394.00px; height: 492.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image32.gif" style="width: 394.00px; height: 492.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The third thing to be done was to build a fence around my field. After that came the reaping, the curing, the carrying home, the thrashing, the parting of the grain from the chaff, the grinding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I needed a mill to do the grinding. I needed a sieve to sift the flour. I needed yeast and salt to mix with the dough. I needed an oven to bake it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had to do without most of these things. And this made my work very slow and hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was very lucky in having saved so many tools from the wreck, and for this I was indeed thankful. What a hard case I would have been in if I had saved nothing at all!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">From time to time, as I felt the need of things I made a number of tools that served me very well. They were not such tools as you would buy at the store, but what did it matter?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I have already told you about the shovel which I made from a piece of hardwood. Next to the shovel I needed a pickax most of all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Among the many things that I had saved from the wreck, I found an old crowbar. This I heated in the fire until it was almost white hot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I then found that I could bend it quite easily. Little by little I shaped it until I had made quite a good pickaxe of it. Of course, it was heavy and not at all pretty. But who would look for beauty in a pickax?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I at first felt the need for some light baskets in which to carry my fruit and grain. So I began to study how baskets are made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not until I had searched almost every nook on the island that I found some long slender twigs that would bend to make wicker ware. Then I spent many an hour learning how to weave these twigs together and shape them into the form of a basket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the end, however, I was able to make as good baskets as were ever bought in the market.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had quite a good number of edge tools. Among these there were three large axes and a great store of hatchets; for you will remember that we carried hatchets to trade with the savages. I also had many knives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But all these became very dull with use. I had saved a grindstone from the wreck, but I could not turn it and grind my tools at the same time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I studied hard to overcome this difficulty. At last, I managed to fasten a string to the crank of the grindstone in such a way that I could turn it with my foot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My tools were soon sharp, and I kept them so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 24:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Harvesting -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Sickle -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Basket -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.8twrmosjo3e7"><span class="c15">25. I Become a Potter</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c16"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">WHEN it came to making bread, I found that I needed several vessels. In fact, I needed them in many ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It would be hard to make wooden vessels. Of course it was out of the question to make vessels of iron or any other metal. But why might I not make some earthen vessels?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If I could find some good clay, I felt quite sure that I could make pots strong enough to be of use.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After much trouble I found the clay. The next thing was to shape it into pots or jars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You would have laughed to see the first things I tried to make. How ugly they were!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Some of them fell in pieces of their own weight. Some of them fell in pieces when I tried to lift them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were of all shapes and sizes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After I had worked two months I had only two large jars that were fit to look at. These I used for holding my rice and barley meal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I tried some smaller things, and did quite well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I made some plates, a pitcher, and some little jars that would hold about a pint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All these I baked in the hot sun. They kept their shape, and seemed quite hard. But of course they would not hold water or bear the heat of the fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day when I was cooking my meat for dinner, I made a very hot fire. When I was done with it, I raked down the coals and poured water on it to put it out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It so happened that one of my little earthenware jars had fallen into the fire and been broken. I had not taken it out, but had left it in the hot flames.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now, as I was raking out the coals, I found some pieces of it and was surprised at the sight of them, for they were burned as hard as stones and as red as tiles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;If broken pieces will burn so,&quot; said I, &quot;why cannot a whole jar be made as hard and as red as these?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had never seen potters at work. I did not know how to build a kiln for firing the pots. I had never heard how earthenware is glazed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I made up my mind to see what could be done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I put several pots and small jars in a pile, one upon another. I laid dry wood all over and about them, and then set it on fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As fast as the wood burned up, I heaped other pieces upon the fire. The hot flames roared all round the jars and pots. The red coals burned beneath them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: -0.00px -0.00px; border: 2.67px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 338.00px; height: 284.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image28.gif" style="width: 338.00px; height: 284.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I kept the fire going all day. I could see the pots become red-hot through and through. The sand on the side of a little jar began to melt and run.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After that I let the fire go down, little by little. I watched it all night, for I did not wish the pots and jars to cool too quickly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the morning I found that I had three very good earthen pots. They were not at all pretty, but they were as hard as rocks and would hold water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had two fine jars also, and one of them was well glazed with the melted sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After this I made all the pots and jars and plates and pans that I needed. They were of all shapes and sizes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You would have laughed to see them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course I was awkward at this work. I was like a child making mud pies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But how glad I was when I found that I had a vessel that would bear the fire! I could hardly wait to put some water in it and boil me some meat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That night I had turtle soup and barley broth for supper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 25:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Potter -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Clay -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Vessel -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.cqutscvh6zdr"><span class="c14">26. I Build a Big Canoe</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c16"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">WHILE I was doing these things I was always trying to think of some way to escape from the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">True, I was living there with much comfort. I was happier than I had ever been while sailing the seas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I longed to see other men. I longed for home and friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You will remember that when I was over at the farther side of the island I had seen land in the distance. Fifty or sixty miles of water lay between me and that land. Yet I was always wishing that I could reach it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a foolish wish. For there was no telling what I might find on that distant shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps it was a far worse place than my little island. Perhaps there were savage beasts there. Perhaps wild men lived there who would kill me and eat me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought of all these things; but I was willing to risk every kind of danger rather than stay where I was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I made up my mind to build a boat. It should be large enough to carry me and all that belonged to me. It should be strong enough to stand a long voyage over stormy seas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had seen the great canoes which Indians sometimes make of the trunks of trees. I would make one of the same kind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the woods I found a cedar tree which I thought was just the right thing for my canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a huge tree. Its trunk was more than five feet through at the bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I chopped and hewed many days before it fell to the ground. It took two weeks to cut a log of the right length from it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I went to work on the log. I chopped and hewed and shaped the outside into the form of a canoe. With hatchet and chisel I hollowed out the inside.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 1.33px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 336.00px; height: 258.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image26.gif" style="width: 336.00px; height: 258.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For full three months I worked on that cedar log. I was both proud and glad when the canoe was finished. I had never seen such a big boat made from a single tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was well shaped and handsome. More than twenty men might find room to sit in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now the hardest question of all must be answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How was I to get my canoe into the water?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It lay not more than three hundred feet from the little river where I had first landed with my raft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But how was I to move it three hundred feet, or even one foot? It was so heavy that I could not even roll it over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought of several plans. But when I came to reckon the time and the labor, I found that even by the easiest plan it would take twenty years to get the canoe into the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What could I do but leave it in the woods where it lay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How foolish I had been! Why had I not thought of the weight of the canoe before going to the labor of making it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The wise man will always look before he leaps. I certainly had not acted wisely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went back to my castle, feeling sad and thoughtful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why should I be discontented and unhappy?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was the master of all that I saw. I might call myself the king of the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had all the comforts of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had plenty of food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I might raise shiploads of grain, but there was no market for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had thousands of trees for timber and fuel, but no one wished to buy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I counted the money which I had brought from the ship.

But I could not go without them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It so happened that I had saved the skins of all the animals I had killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stretched every skin on a framework of sticks. and hung it up in the sun to dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In time I had a great many of these skins. Some were coarse and stiff and fit for nothing. Others were soft to the touch and very pretty to look at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day I took one of the finest and made me a cap of it. I left all the hair on the outside, so as to shoot off the rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was not very pretty; but it was of great use, and what more did I want?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did so well with the cap that I thought I would try something else. So, after a great deal of trouble, I made me a whole suit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I made me a waistcoat and a pair of knee breeches. I wanted them to keep me cool rather than warm. So I made them quite loose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You would have laughed to see them. They were funny things, I tell you. But when I went out in the rain, they kept me dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This, I think, put me in mind of an umbrella.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had seen umbrellas in Brazil, although they were not yet common in England.

I Have a Perilous Adventure</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I HAD never given up the idea of having a canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My first trial, as you have seen, was a failure. I had made too big a boat, and I had made it too far from the water. I could do better another time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day after I had harvested my grain, I set to work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no tree near the river that was fit for a canoe. But I found a fine one nearly half a mile away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before I began to chop the tree, I made all my plans for taking the canoe to the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I worked now with a will, for I felt sure that I would succeed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a few weeks the little vessel was finished. It was a very pretty canoe, and large enough for only two or three persons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Small as it was, it was quite heavy. For you must remember that it was a part of the tree, hollowed out and shaped like a boat. It was as much as I could do to lift one end of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How should I ever get it to the river?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I have already told you that I had made plans for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Through the soft ground between the river and the canoe I dug a big ditch. It was four feet deep and six feet wide and nearly half a mile long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I worked at this ditch for nearly two years. When it was done and filled with water from the river, I slid my canoe into it. It floated, as I knew it would.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I pushed it along to the end of the great ditch and out into the river, it looked very small. I could never hope to make a long voyage in it!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I could sail round the island, and make little journeys close to the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Before starting out, I put up a mast in the prow of the canoe and made a sail for it from a piece of the ship&#39;s sail that I had kept with great care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then at each end of the little vessel I made lockers or small boxes, in which I put a supply of food and other things that I would need on my voyage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the inside of the vessel I cut a little, long, hollow place or shelf where I could lay my gun; and above this I tacked a long flap of goatskin to hang down over it and keep it dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the stern I set up my umbrella, so that it would keep the hot sun off of me while I was steering the canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 398.00px; height: 294.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image20.gif" style="width: 398.00px; height: 294.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then every day I made short trips down the river to the sea and back again. Sometimes, when the wind was fair, I sailed a little way out; but I was afraid to go far.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I made up my mind for a voyage around the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I filled my lockers with food. In one I put two dozen barley cakes and a pot full of parched rice. In the other I stored the hind quarters of a goat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I also put in powder and shot enough to kill as much game as I would need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On a day in November I set sail on my voyage. It proved to be a harder voyage than I had bargained for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, there were so many rocks along the shore that I sometimes had to sail for miles out into the sea to get around them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, when I was on the farther side of the island, I struck a furious current of water that was pouring round a point of land like the stream of a mill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could do nothing in such a current. My canoe was whirled along like a leaf in a whirlwind. The sail was of no use. The little vessel spun round and round in the eddies and was carried far out to sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave myself up for lost. I was so far out that I could hardly see the low shores of my island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly I noticed that the canoe was only a little way from the edge of the current. Just beyond it the water was quite calm and smooth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took up my paddle again and paddled with all my might. With great joy I soon found myself floating in quiet water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The wind was fair for the shore, and I set my sail again. The canoe sped swiftly back toward the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw then that I was sailing midway between two strong currents. If I should be caught in either, I would again be carried out to sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I needed all the skill I had to steer the canoe aright. At last, when the sun was almost down, I brought it into a quiet little cove where the shore was green with grass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 28:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Adventure -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Savage -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Escape - </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.thaahgn7252s"><span class="c38">29</span><span class="c15">.

It was a hot day, and I walked slowly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stopped often to rest, and did not reach my summer house until it was growing dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw that everything was standing just as I had left it; for I always kept it in good order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as I got over the fence, I sat down to rest; and I was so tired that I fell asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then, all at once in the darkness, I heard a voice calling me, &quot;Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was so full of sleep that I did not wake up at once.

In a short time I had crushed enough barley to make meal for a large loaf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was easy to make the dough. I had only to mix the meal with water and knead it with my hands. I must not think of yeast to make the dough light.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The baking part was the main thing, and the hardest to learn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first I put my biscuits of dough in the hot ashes and left them there till they were baked. But I did not like these ash cakes very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I tried another plan.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I made two large earthen vessels. They were broad and shallow. Each was about two feet across and not more than nine inches deep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These I burned in the fire till they were as hard as rocks and as red as tiles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I made also a hearth before my fireplace, and paved it with some square tiles of my own making. But, perhaps I ought not to call them square.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The hearth, when finished, was quite level and smooth. It was as pretty as I could have wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Next I built a great fire of hard wood. When the wood had burned down, I raked the hot coals out upon my hearth. I left them there till the hearth was hot through and through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My loaves of dough were all ready. I swept hearth clean and then put the loaves down upon the hottest part of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Over each loaf I put one of the large earthen vessels I had made. Then I heaped hot coals on the top of the vessel and all round the sides of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a short time I lifted the vessels and took out my loaves. They were baked as well as the best oven in the world could have baked them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By trying and trying again, I at last learned to bake almost everything I wanted. I baked cakes and rice pudding fit for a king. But I did not care for pies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I now felt quite contented and prosperous. For did I not have everything that I needed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had two homes on the island. I called them my plantations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first of these was my strong castle under the rock. I had enlarged it until my cave contained many rooms, one opening into another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The largest and driest of these was my storeroom. Here I kept the largest of my earthen pots. Here also were fourteen or fifteen big baskets, all filled with grain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My sitting room was not large, but it was made for comfort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for the wall in front of the castle, it was a wonderful thing. The long stakes which I had driven down had all taken root. They had grown like trees, and were now so big and so thick with branches that it was hard to see between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No one passing by would ever think there was a house behind this matted row of trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, were my two barley fields. These I cultivated with care, and from them I reaped a good harvest. As often as I felt the need of more barley I made my fields larger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Farther away was what I called my country seat. There was my pleasant summer house or bower, where I liked to go for rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the middle of my bower I had my tent always set. It was made of a piece of sail spread over some poles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Under the tent I had made a soft couch with the skins of animals and a blanket thrown over them. Here, when the weather was fair, I often slept at night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A little way from the bower was the field in which I kept my cattle&mdash;that is to say, my goats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had taken great pains to fence and inclose this field. I was so fearful, lest the goats should break out, that I worked many a day planting a hedge all around. The hedge grew to be very tall and was as strong as a wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the shore of the sea, some distance beyond my summer house, was the little inlet where I had laid up my canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 30:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Prosperous -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Cattle -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Mill -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.m1efygkfv4o1"><span class="c15">31. I See Something in the Sand</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c16"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">WHEN the weather was fine I often went over to the other side of the island to look at my canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sometimes I spent several days at my summer house. Then, going over to where the canoe was kept, I took short sails along the shore. These little voyages gave me a great deal of pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One morning as I was going to the canoe a strange thing happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was walking slowly along and looking down, and what do you think I saw?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw the print of a man&#39;s naked foot in the sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sight made me cold all over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stood like one that had seen a ghost. I looked around. I listened. I trembled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 350.00px; height: 390.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image44.gif" style="width: 350.00px; height: 390.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went to the top of a little hill to look farther. Then I walked up the shore and down the shore. I saw no other tracks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went back to make sure that I was not dreaming. Yes, there in the sand was the print of man&#39;s foot. It showed the toes, the heel, and the sole of the foot. I was not dreaming.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My mind was filled with a thousand thoughts and questions. Where was the man who made that track? Who was he? How did he get there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was so frightened that I did not go to the canoe. I turned back and went to my castle as fast as I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether I went over by the ladder or through the hole in the rock, I do not know. But I shut myself up as quickly as I could and began to get ready to defend myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">That night I could not sleep. I lay in my hammock, and thought and thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The track must have been made by an Indian or some other wild savage. This savage had come perhaps from the land that I had seen far across the sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps he had come to the island alone. Perhaps he had come with many others of his kind. But where was he now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was so much afraid that I did not stir out of my castle for three days and nights. I was almost starved, for I had only two or three barley cakes in my kitchen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Little by little I became brave enough to go out again. I crept softly down to my fields to milk the goats. Poor things! They were glad enough to see me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But every sound made me start and look around. I fancied that I saw a savage behind every tree. I lived for days like some hunted thing that trembles at its own shadow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And all because I had seen the print of a foot in the sand!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Little by little I grew bolder, and I made up my mind to strengthen my castle. If savage Indians should indeed come and find me, I would be ready for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I carried out earth and small stones, and piled them up against the castle wall till it was ten feet thick. I have already told you how strong it was at first, and how I had made a dense hedge of trees on the outside. It was now so strong that nothing could break through it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Through the wall at certain places I made five holes large enough for a man&#39;s arm to reach in. In each of these holes I planted a gun; for you will remember that I brought several from the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Each one of these guns was fitted in a frame that could be drawn back and forth. They worked so well in their places that I could shoot off all five of them in less than two minutes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Many a weary month did I work before I had my wall to my liking. But at last it was finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The hedge that was before it grew up so thick and high that no man nor animal could see through it. If you had seen it, you would not have dreamed there was anything inside of it, much less a house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For two years I lived in fear. All that I did was to make my home stronger and safer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Far in the woods I built a large pen of logs and stakes. Around it I planted a hedge like that in front of the castle. Then I put a dozen young goats into it, to feed upon the grass and grow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If savages should come, and if they should kill the other goats, they could not find these; for they were too well hidden in the deep woods.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All these things I did because I had seen the print of a man&#39;s foot in the sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 31:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Footprint -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Bolder -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Fancied -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_09_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246756001204&amp;usg=AOvVaw31_YHz3t18mfsB7oUGV2vG">33-35</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.csjbh1q73sjn"><span class="c15">32.

So I kept on the lookout for them all the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My flock of goats had now grown to be very large, and I needed another field. I wished to put some of them in a hidden spot where the savages, if they did come, would not find them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had already a small flock in one such spot, as I have told you. But now I wished to have another.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In looking for the right kind of place, I went all over the island. I even went far out on a rocky point beyond the place where I kept my canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I was standing on a rock and looking out to sea, I thought I saw a boat in the distance. I was only a little speck on the water, and it seemed to rise and fall with the waves. It could not be a rock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked at it till my eyes could look no more. I had saved a spyglass out of the ship; but, as luck would have it, I had left it at home. How I wished for it then!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether I really saw a boat or not, I do not know. But as I walked back along the shore, I made up my mind never to go out again without my spyglass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I walked slowly along, thinking of what I had seen. All at once I came upon that which made my heart stand still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the sandy, sloping beach of a pleasant little harbor I saw not only one footprint, but hundreds of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stood still, afraid to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But the footprints were not all. The beach at one place was covered with bones and bits of flesh, as in a slaughter house. Some of the bones were quite fresh; some had been charred with fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Here the savages have been holding a feast,&quot; I said to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A little farther on I saw that a pit had been dug in the sand, and here they had had their fire. The ashes were still warm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wondered what kind of a feast these wild men had been having. There were savages on the mainland who were said to kill and eat the captives whom they took in war. Cannibals, they were called.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Could this have been a feast of cannibals? And were these the bones and flesh of human beings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I trembled as I thought of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I turned and ran from the place as fast as I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I ran until I could go no farther. My breath came fast. I sank down upon the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I had rested a little while, I looked around and found that I was not very far from my castle. All around me was peaceful and still. I was surely safe from harm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With tears in my eyes I knelt down and gave thanks to God. I thanked him that he had kept me alive and safe through so many years. I thanked him that I had been cast on the side of the island which was never visited by savages. I thanked him for all the comforts and blessings that were mine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I arose and went home to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I sat before my door that evening, I thought the whole matter over, and felt much easier in my mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had been on the island eighteen years before I saw the first footprint. I had been there twenty-three years before I saw any other signs of savages. It was likely that many more years would pass before any harm should come to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With these thoughts I lay down in my hammock and slept without fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it was a long time before I went again to the farther shore of the island. I did not even go to look after my canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The days went quietly by. I kept quite close to my castle, and busied myself with my goats and my grain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was always on my guard, and never stepped out of doors without first looking around me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 32:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Alarmed -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Blessings -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Signs -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.vesigej3iokx"><span class="c15">33. I Make a Surprising Discovery</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c10 c16"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">ONCE every week I went into the woods to see the flock of goats that I had hidden there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I always carried my gun, but since my last great fright I did not dare to fire it off. I was afraid even to drive a nail or chop a stick of wood, lest some savages might be near enough to hear the sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was afraid to build a fire at my castle, lest the smoke should be seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I carried some of my pots and kettles to my hidden field in the woods. I could do my cooking there much more safely than at my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hardly had I put things in order there when I found something that made me very glad. What do you suppose it was?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a cave&mdash;a real cave. The door into it was through a little hollow place at the bottom of a great rock. It was so well hidden that no one could have found it even by looking for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Shall I tell you how I came upon it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was afraid to make smoke near my house, and yet I could not live without cooking meat. I tried all kinds of dry wood, and yet there was always some smoke. Then I thought I would try charcoal. But I must first make charcoal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found a place in the darkest part of the woods where the smoke would hardly rise to the tops of the trees. There I built my charcoal pit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was done in the following way:&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">First, I cleared off a round space about ten feet in diameter. Here I dug out the earth till I made a pit about a foot deep. Then I cut a cord or more of wood and piled it up in this space. I piled it up until it was almost as high as my shoulders. I covered it a foot deep with earth and turf, leaving a small open place at the bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 392.00px; height: 364.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image45.gif" style="width: 392.00px; height: 364.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When this was done, I set fire to the wood through the hole in the bottom. It burned slowly. The wood became charcoal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One day, while cutting wood for my charcoal pit, I happened to see a hollow place in the rock close to a tree I was chopping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was half covered with brush. I pushed this aside and looked in. I saw a little cave just large enough for me to creep into on my hands and knees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But, a little farther in, it was larger. It was so high that I could stand upright, and it was so wide that two men could have walked in it side by side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a very dark place, and I stood still a moment till my eyes should become a little used to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All at once I saw something in the darkness that made me scramble out of that place much faster than I had come into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What do you think it was? Two big shining eyes that glowed like coals in the darkness. Whether they were the eyes of a man or of some fierce beast, I did not stop to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stood a little while by the mouth of the cave and then I began to get over my fright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What could there be in this cave that would do me harm? No man could live there in the darkness. As for any animal, I knew there was nothing fiercer on the island than one of my cats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, with a blazing stick for a torch, I crept back into the cave. But I had not gone three steps before I was frightened almost as much as before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I heard a loud sigh, like that of a man in trouble. Then there were low moans, and sounds as of some one trying to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I stopped short. Cold chills ran down my back. My hair seemed to stand on end. But I would not allow myself to run out again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I pushed my little torch forward into the darkness, as far as I could. The blaze lit up the cave. And what do you suppose I saw then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why, nothing but a shaggy old goat that I had missed from my flock for nearly a week past.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was stretched on the floor of the cave, and too weak to rise up. He was a very old fellow, and perhaps had gone in there to die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave him some food and water, and made him as comfortable as I could. But he was too far gone to live long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found that, although I could stand up in the cave, it was very small. It was only a hole in the rocks, and was neither round nor square.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But at the end of this little chamber there seemed to be a passage that led farther in. This passage was very narrow and dark, and as my torch had burned out, I did not try to follow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went back to my wood chopping.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 33:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Blaze -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Visitor -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Chamber -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.t6xanx451zii"><span class="c15">34. I Explore My Cave Further</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">THE next day I brought out with me six big candles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For you must know that I was a candle maker as well as a baker. Indeed, I made very good candles of goats&#39; tallow, using some bits of old ropes for the wicks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I have just said, I took six candles with me, for I had made up my mind to learn more about the cave I had found.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I lit two of the candles, and went in. The poor old goat was dead, and it was no easy work to dig a hole right there and bury him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After this unpleasant task was done, I went into the back part of the cave. The flame of the candles lighted up the darkness, and I could see quite plainly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The narrow passage of which I have told you was no less than thirty feet long. In one place it was so low that I had to creep through on all fours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But no sooner was I through this low place than I found myself in a splendid chamber. It was large enough to shelter a hundred men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Indeed, it seemed like the great hall of some old English castle. I had never seen anything so grand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The roof was at least twenty feet high. The light from my two candles shone upon the walls and made it look as though covered with thousands of bright stars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 324.00px; height: 471.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image21.gif" style="width: 324.00px; height: 471.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whether these were diamonds, or gold, or some other precious things, I did not know, and in fact I never learned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The floor was dry and level. It was covered with white sand, which was very clean.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was delighted. No better or safer storehouse could I have wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I had looked at the room on every side and found that it was really the end of the cave, I went out and hurried back to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found that I still had about sixty pounds of powder. This was the first thing that I carried to my new cavern. I took thither also the lead that I had for making bullets and small shot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I felt now like one of the wonderful elves that you read about. They live, as you know, in rocks and in caves where none can get at them; and they have hidden treasures of gold and precious stones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What if a hundred savages should hunt me? They could not come near me here. I was safe from all foes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I fitted the cave up with whatever was needed to make it comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the worst came to the worst, I meant to live there. And yet I did not wish to be obliged to do this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When everything was safe and snug, I laid some green branches over the entrance and went back to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was very glad when I sat down in my old kitchen again. For, after all, no other place was so much like home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had now been twenty-three years on this island. If it had not been for fear of savages, I would have been the happiest man in the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">During all those years I had been very busy. I did not work all the time, as you know, but I amused myself in various ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I spent much time with Poll, the parrot. He soon learned to talk so well that it was a pleasure to hear him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My dog had been my best friend and companion. He lived for sixteen years, and then died of old age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for my cats, the woods were full of them. All ran wild except the two that I kept in my castle. These were good mousers and fine pets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had also several tame fowls. These I had caught near the seashore when they were young. I cut their wing feathers short and taught them to eat from my hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I never knew what kind of birds they were, but they were large, almost as large as chickens. They lived among the hedge trees in front of my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They made their nests there and kept me well supplied with eggs. I did not need to keep any other poultry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus I lived very pleasantly in my island home. I would have been content to live there always if I could have felt safe from savages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 34:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Cave -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Fowl -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Poultry -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.4fy2y8lu05ue"><span class="c15">35. I See Savages</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">EARLY one morning in harvest time I went out to my grain fields to cut down some barley. The days were so very hot that it was pleasanter to rise before daylight and do the heavier part of my work before the sun was high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 398.00px; height: 290.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.gif" style="width: 398.00px; height: 290.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On this morning of which I am telling you, I started out while it was still quite dark. I had been to the fields so often that I could have found the way with my eyes shut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I went along, I was surprised to see a light far over toward my side of the island. I stopped and looked. It was plainly the light of a blazing fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Who could have built a fire there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Surely none but savages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was so surprised that I stood still and wondered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What if those savages should find my grain fields?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They would know at once that somebody had planted them, and they would never rest till they should find me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could now see the blaze quite plainly. As the day dawned, I could also see the smoke rising above the trees. The fire was not more than two miles away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I hurried back to my castle as fast as I could run. I made everything on the outside of it look as wild as possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I climbed over the wall and pulled up the ladder after me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I loaded all my cannon, as I called the guns, that I had placed in the wall. I put everything in order for a siege.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I waited to see if any enemy would come near.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two hours, three hours passed, and there was no sight nor sound that was at all uncommon. I began to wonder if, after all, the fire had been kindled by some accident and not by strange men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I could wait no longer. I set up my ladder against the side of the rock and climbed up to a flat place above my castle. I pulled the ladder up after me and then mounted to another landing. I pulled it up a second time, and it now reached to the top of the great rock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Here was the place I called my lookout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Very carefully I climbed up. I laid myself down upon the rock and through my spyglass looked over toward the place where I had seen the fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could still see the smoke. Yes, and I could see some naked savages sitting around a small fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I counted them, and made out that there were no fewer than nine of the wretches.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They surely did not need a fire to warm themselves by, for the day was very hot. No doubt they were cooking something. Perhaps they were cannibals and were getting ready for one of their horrible feasts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">On the beach not far from them I saw the two canoes in which they had arrived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tide was now at its lowest. When it returned and floated the canoes, they would probably go away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This thought made me feel much easier, for I was sure they would not wander far inland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I waited and watched till the tide was again at the flood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I saw them all get into the boats and paddle away. They seemed to be going around to the other side of the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could now breathe freely again. As soon as they were well gone, I armed myself and hurried across the land to see if I could get another sight of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I carried two guns on my shoulder, two pistols in my belt, and a big sword at my side. You would have been frightened, had you seen me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a long, hard walk. But by and by I came to the hill that overlooked the farther shore of the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This I climbed. I scanned sea and land with my spyglass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yes, there were the two canoes coming slowly around the coast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But what was my surprise to see three other boats put off from a cove nearby and hasten around to meet them!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seemed, then, that another party of savages had been feasting at the very spot where I had seen the first footprint in the sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I watched the canoes until all five were far out to sea, on their way to the low-lying shore in the distant west.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I went down to the place where the savages had been feasting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What a dreadful sight met my eyes! The sand was covered with blood and bones. No doubt some poor captive had been killed there and eaten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I made up my mind that if any other savages should ever come to my island for such a feast, I would not let them enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gathered up the bones and buried them in the sand. Then I went slowly and sadly back to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After that I never felt quite safe at any time. I dared not fire a gun; I dared not build a fire; I dared not walk far from home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While awake, I was always planning how to escape the savages. While asleep, I was always dreaming of dreadful things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yet days and months passed by, and still no other savages came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 35:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Savages -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Encounter -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Dreadful -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_10_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246756029479&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YofP6vw5RK1LoftMa1A4s">36-37</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.lnfbat8vgu0y"><span class="c15">36. I Discover a Wreck</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c16"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">ONE day in May a great storm burst upon the island. All day and far into the night the rain fell and the wind blew, the lightnings flashed, and the thunder rolled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I was used to such storms, and I minded it but little. I stayed home in my castle, and felt very thankful that I had a place so safe and dry and comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I sat up quite late, reading my Bible by the light of a little lamp I had made, and thinking of my strange lot in life. Suddenly I heard a sound which I felt sure was the noise of a gun fired at sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I started up quickly. I threw on my raincoat and mounted to my lookout on the top of the great rock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rain had stopped and the wind was going down. It was now past midnight, and very dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A moment after I had reached my place there was a flash of light that caused me to stop and listen for another gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a few seconds I heard it. It seemed to come from that part of the sea where I was once caught by the strong current and driven far out in my boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I knew at once that the shots were fired from some ship in distress. Perhaps she was being driven upon the shore by the wind and waves. Could I do anything to help the poor men on board?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With great labor and danger to myself I gathered some sticks and brush into a pile on the rock and set it on fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The wood was not dry, but when the fire was once kindled it blazed up fiercely and cast a light over all the rocks and trees about me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I felt sure that if there were sailors on the ship, they could not help but see it. And no doubt they did see it, for I soon heard another gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All night long I kept the fire burning; but no other sound besides the wind did I hear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When it was broad day and the mists had cleared away, I turned my spyglass toward that part of the sea from which the sounds came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Far away from the shore there was surely something; but whether it was a wreck or a ship under sail, I could not tell. The distance was too great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I watched it from time to time all day. It did not move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It must be a ship at anchor,&quot; I said to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Early the next morning I took my gun and went down toward that side of the island where the current had once caught me. When I had come to the shore there, I climbed upon some rocks and looked out over the sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The air was very clear now, and I could plainly see the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She was not at anchor.

Even among the rocks the water was smooth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing everything thus favorable, I made up my mind to get my canoe and go out to the wreck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I hurried back to my castle to get things ready for my voyage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I packed a big basket with bread; I filled a jug with fresh water; I put a compass in my pocket that I might have it to steer by; I threw a bag full of raisins upon my shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Loaded with all these necessary things, I went round to the place where my canoe was hidden. I found her half full of water, for she had been lying there neglected for a long time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With much labor I bailed the water out of her and got her afloat. Then I loaded my cargo into her, and hurried home for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My second load was a bag full of rice, the umbrella to set up over my head for shade, another jug of water, a cheese, a bottle of milk, and about two dozen barley cakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All these I carried around to my canoe. If there were men on board the wreck they might be in need of food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I had arranged everything in good order, I started out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I kept the canoe quite close to the shore until I had rounded the point past which the dangerous current flowed. Being then in smooth water, I struck boldly out toward the wreck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon, however, upon looking a little ahead of me, I saw the second current flowing in a great eddy past a long line of half-hidden rocks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I looked on these rapid currents, my heart began to fail me. I knew that if I should be driven into one of them, it would carry me a great way out to sea. It would carry me so far that I should never be able to get back again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yet I was determined to persevere in my venture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 36:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Wreck -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rapid -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Currents -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.e7ak24ezj9fq"><span class="c15">37. I Make Another Voyage</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">WITH very great care I steered my canoe out to sea. I kept just within the edge of the current on my right hand. It carried me along at a great rate, but I did not lose control of the canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In about two hours I came up to the wreck. It was a sad sight to look at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The ship lay partly on her side, and was jammed fast between two great rocks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 295.15px; height: 203.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image22.gif" style="width: 295.15px; height: 203.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She looked like a Spanish ship. She had been badly broken by the waves, and everything on her decks had been swept away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I came close to her, a dog looked over her side and barked at me. When I called him he jumped into the sea and swam out to the canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I lifted him on board, and found that he was almost dead with hunger and thirst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave him a barley cake, and he devoured it like a half-starved wolf. I then gave him a little water, but not too much lest he should harm himself. He drank, and then looked up as if asking for more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After this I went on board. A sad sight met my eyes. For in the cookroom I saw two sailors who had been drowned, with their arms fast around each other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I suppose that when the ship struck the waves dashed all over her and the men had no way of escape. Those who were not swept overboard were drowned between decks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides the dog there was no other live thing on board.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found some chests that had belonged to the sailors. With much labor I got two of them into the canoe without stopping to look inside of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Besides these chests, I took a fire shovel and tongs, which I needed very much. I found, also, two little brass kettles, a gridiron, and a large copper pot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tide was now setting in toward the island again. So, with the few goods I had found and the poor dog, I started for home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By keeping on the outside of the eddying current I had no trouble in bringing the canoe safe to land. The sun was almost down when I anchored her in a little inlet just off the point of rocks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was so tired that I could do nothing more that day. So, after eating my supper, of which I gave the dog a good share, I lay down in the canoe and went to sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I slept very soundly, and did not wake until morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In looking over my goods, I made up my mind to store them in my new cave in the woods. For that was much nearer than my home castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I opened the chests I found several things that I was very glad to get.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In one I found two jars of very good sweetmeats. They were so well corked that the salt water had not harmed them. There were two other jars of the same kind; but they were open at the top, and the water had spoiled the sweetmeats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the other chest there were some good shirts, which I needed very much. There were also about a dozen and a half of white linen handkerchiefs. I was very glad to find these, for they would be pleasant to wipe my face with on a hot day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In a secret drawer of the first chest I found three bags of Spanish money. I counted eleven hundred pieces of silver.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the bottom of one of the bags there were six Spanish gold pieces, each worth about fifteen dollars. These were wrapped up in a piece of paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the bottom of the other bag there were some small bars of gold. I suppose there was at least a pound of these yellow pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After all, I got very little by this voyage. I had no use for the money. It was worth no more to me than the dust under my feet. I would have given it all for a pair of good shoes or some stockings for my feet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After I had carried everything to my cave I took the canoe back to her old harbor on the farther side of the island. Then I returned to my castle, where I found everything in good order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And now I began to live easily again. I was as watchful as before, and never went from my castle without looking carefully around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I seldom went to the other side of the island. When I visited my cave in the woods, or went to see my goats, I took good care to be well armed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 37:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Eddying -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Seldom -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Survival -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_11_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246756042054&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kPzLwRdLKT27_eEm6qo3v">38-40</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.vnse0nj5fohp"><span class="c15">38. I Have a Queer Dream</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">TWO years passed without any alarms, and I was beginning to think that nothing would ever again happen to disturb the quiet of my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One night in the rainy season of March I could not sleep. I lay for hours in my hammock and was not able to close my eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was thinking, thinking, thinking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought of all that had ever happened to me both before and after my shipwreck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought of my first happy years on the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought of the fear and care that I had lived in ever since I saw the first footprint in the sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I thought of my great desire to see my native land once more, and to have friends and companions with whom I could talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These thoughts brought to mind the savages of whom I had so great a dread, and I began to ask myself a thousand questions about them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How far off was the coast from which they came?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why did they come to my island from so great a distance?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What kind of boats did they have?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With such thoughts as these I lay awake until far in the night.

I had never been so sad and lonely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was thinking of the home I was never to see again, and of the friends who perhaps had forgotten me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly, as I lifted my eyes, I thought I saw two canoes coming toward the island. I ran and hid myself in a grove by the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were eleven savages in the canoes, and they had with them another savage whom they were going to kill and eat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I thought in my sleep that this savage suddenly sprang up and ran for his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought that he came running to the little grove, to hide himself in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Seeing him alone, I arose and met him. I smiled kindly, and tried to make him know that I was his friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He threw himself on the ground at my feet. He seemed to be asking my help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I showed him my ladder and made him go up over the wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I led him into my castle, and he became my servant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought in my sleep, that I cried aloud for joy and said: &quot;Now I shall escape from this place. For this savage will be my pilot. He will guide me to the mainland. He will tell where to go and what to do. He will help me find my own people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This thought filled my mind with great joy and while I was still rejoicing I awoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What a disappointment it was to find that it was only a dream!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For several days I felt very sad. I was almost ready to give up hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I remembered my dream; and I said to myself: &quot;If I could only get hold of a savage and teach him to love me, things might turn out just that way. He must be one of their prisoners and I must save him from being eaten; for then it will be easy to win his friendship.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This thought so fixed itself in my mind that I could not get rid of it. Waking or sleeping, I seemed to be always planning to get hold of a savage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I set myself about it in earnest. Almost every day I went out with my gun to see if some of these wild men had not again landed on my island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 38:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Savage -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Queer -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Rejoicing -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.l9p0yy3d4k10"><span class="c38">39</span><span class="c15">. I Get Hold of a Savage</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">FOR a year and a half I kept close watch upon the farther shore of the island as well as upon that nearest to my castle. But not a single savage came near.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One morning in June, however, I had a great surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was just starting out from my castle when I saw five canoes lying high and dry on the beach not a mile away. There was not man near them. The people who had come in them were perhaps asleep among the trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The number of canoes was greater than I had ever counted upon seeing. For there were always four or six savages in each canoe, and there must now be between twenty and thirty men somewhere on the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did not know what to think of it. I did not feel brave enough to attack so many.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I stayed in my castle and made ready to defend myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;There is little hope of getting a savage this time,&quot; I thought to myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I waited a long while, but heard no unusual sound. I grew tired of waiting, and made up my mind to see what was going on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So, with the help of my ladder, I climbed up to my lookout on the top of the rock. I put my spyglass to my eyes and looked down upon the beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Surely enough! there they were. I saw no fewer than thirty naked savages dancing around a fire. I saw that they were broiling meat upon the coals, but I could not tell what kind of meat it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I watched I saw some of the dancers run to a boat and drag two miserable prisoners from it. They must have been in the boat all the time, but as they were lying down I did not see them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All the dancers now crowded around the poor prisoners. They knocked one of them down with a club, and then fell upon him with their knives. I supposed they were going to cut him up for their horrid feast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For a few moments they seemed to forget the other prisoner, for they left him standing alone at one side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All at once he made a break for liberty. You never saw a hound run so fast. He ran along the sandy beach, right toward my castle. I was dreadfully frightened. I thought that now my dream was coming true, and that he would surely hide in my grove.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But would the other part of the dream come true? Would the other savages lose sight of him, and running another way, not come near the castle? I feared not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, I stayed in my lookout and watched to see what would happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw, to my joy, that only three of the savage followed him. He ran so fast that he gained ground on them. If he could hold out for ten or fifteen minutes, he would get away from them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Between the savages and my castle there was the little river where I had first landed with my raft. If the poor fellow could not swim across this stream, he would surely be taken. I watched to see what he would do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To my surprise the river did not hinder him at all. The tide was up, but he plunged in and with twenty or thirty strokes was across. I had never seen a finer swimmer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When his pursuers reached the stream, he was already far away. Two of them jumped in and swam across. The other one stood still a minute and then turned softly back. It was lucky for him that he could not swim.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Now,&quot; thought I to myself, &quot;now is the time to get me a savage!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In another moment I was down in my castle. I picked up my two guns. I was over the wall in less time than it takes me to tell about it. Never once did I think of fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I ran swiftly down the hill toward the sea. In another minute I was between the poor captive and his pursuers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hello, there! Come back! I will help you,&quot; I cried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of course he did not understand a word. But he heard me and looked back. I beckoned to him with my hand, and this he understood better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was no time for waiting, however. The two savages that followed were close upon me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I rushed upon the foremost one and knocked him down with my gun. I did not want to shoot, lest the other savages would hear the noise and come to his rescue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The second pursuer came, running and panting, only a little way behind. When he saw me, he stopped as if he were frightened. I ran toward him, with my gun to my shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I came nearer, I saw that he had a bow and arrow and was taking aim at me. What could I do but shoot? He fell to the ground and never moved again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I now looked around to see what had become of the poor captive. I saw him standing still and gazing at me. The noise of my gun had frightened him so that he did not know what to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I called to him: &quot;Come here, my good fellow I will not hurt you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But of course he did not understand. Then I motioned to him with signs. He came a little way and then stopped. He came a little farther and stopped again. He was trembling like a leaf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">No doubt he was afraid that he would be killed as his two pursuers had been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I spoke kindly to him and made signs that I would not hurt him. He came nearer and nearer, trembling, and kneeling down at almost every step.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I smiled; I looked as pleasant as I could; I made still other signs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He came quite close to me. He laid his head upon the ground. He took hold of my foot and set it on his neck. This was his way of saying that he would be my slave forever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 273.35px; height: 318.91px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.gif" style="width: 273.35px; height: 318.91px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took hold of his hand and lifted him up.

I Am Pleased with My Man Friday</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c27 c16"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">THE savage spoke to me. I could not understand his words, but they were very pleasant to hear. For it had now been more than twenty-five years since I had heard the sound of a man&#39;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He pointed to the two savages who had been pursuing him. They were lying on the ground where they had fallen. Both were quite dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He could not understand how I had killed the second savage when he was so far away from me. He made signs that I should let him see whether his enemy was really dead or only pretending to be so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told him, as well as I could, that he might go to him. He ran to the fallen savage and looked at him. He turned him first on one side and then on the other. He seemed very much puzzled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he picked up the savage&#39;s bow and arrows and brought them to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I turned to go back to my castle and beckoned him to follow me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He stood quite still for a moment and then pointed again to the bodies on the ground. By signs he asked me if he might bury them, lest the other savages should come up and find them there. I answered by signs and gave him leave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The work was quickly done. With a sharp stick and his big hands he soon dug two big holes in the sand. He laid the bodies in them and covered them up. Then he smoothed the sand and patted it down so that no one could see that it had been touched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having thus put the two savages out of sight he turned to me again. I motioned him to follow me. But on second thought I did not go back to the castle. I led him far into the woods, to my new cave of which I have told you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once inside of that cave, I felt safe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave the poor fellow some bread and a bunch of raisins to eat. I gave him also a drink of water from a jug, and he was so thirsty from running that he came near drinking it all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I showed him a place where I had put some rice straw with a blanket over it. It was quite a good bed, and I myself had sometimes slept upon it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He seemed to know that I meant for him to lie down there and rest. Soon he was fast asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He was a handsome fellow. He was tall but not too large.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His hair was long and black. His forehead was high and broad. His eyes were very bright.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His face was round and plump. His nose was well shaped. His lips were thin. His teeth were white as ivory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His skin was not black like that of an African. It was not yellow like that of some Indians. But it was a kind of olive color, very pleasant to look at.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After he had been asleep about an hour he awoke and came out of the cave where I was milking my goats. He made signs to show that he was glad to see me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then he laid his head flat down on the ground and set my foot upon it, as he had done before. This was his way of saying that he would do anything I wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I understood him and told him by signs that I was well pleased with him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I spoke some simple words to him and tried to teach him what they meant. He was quick to learn and soon began to try to talk to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I named him FRIDAY because it was on that day of the week that I had saved his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He soon learned to call me &quot;Master,&quot; and to say &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; in the right way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the evening I gave him an earthen pot with some milk in it, and showed him how to sop his bread in the milk. I also gave him a barley cake, which he ate as though it was very good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All that night we stayed in the cave. But early the next morning I led him back to my castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My first care was to learn whether the savages had left the island. I climbed to the top of the rock and looked around with my spyglass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I saw the place where the savages had been. I saw where they had built their fire. But they were not there. I could see no sign of them or of their canoes. It was plain that they had left the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave my man Friday one of my guns to carry. In his right hand he held my sword, and on his back were his bow and arrows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I carried two guns myself. And thus armed we went boldly down to the beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sand was red with blood, and bones and bits of flesh were scattered all around. These I caused Friday to gather up and bury.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 194.56px; height: 273.37px;"><img alt="" src="images/image29.gif" style="width: 194.56px; height: 273.37px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We stayed on the beach for some time, but could find nothing more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Friday gave me to understand that there had been three other prisoners in the boats with him. I had no doubt that the savages had killed and eaten them all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next day I made a tent for Friday to stay in. It was just inside of my castle wall and in front of the door into my own sleeping room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As he had no clothes I set to work to make him a suit. I gave him some linen trousers which had belonged to one of our sailors, and which I had not worn because they were too small.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I made him a little jacket of goatskin, and from the skin of a rabbit I fashioned a very good cap that fitted his head quite well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You should have seen him when he was clothed. He was very proud, but oh, so awkward!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He went around with a broad smile on his face. He tried to do everything that was pleasing to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And indeed I was much delighted with him. For no man ever had a more faithful servant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 40:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Friday -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Delighted -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Scattered -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_12_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246756058492&amp;usg=AOvVaw1edoG8E0T6PTinwUUwfW6F">41-42</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.vb04s782z18n"><span class="c15">41. I Teach Friday Many Things</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">WHEN my man Friday had been with me three days I took him out hunting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As we were going through some woods, I saw a wild goat lying under a tree with two young kids sitting by her. I caught hold of Friday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Stop,&quot; I said. &quot;Stand still.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I took aim at one of the kids, shot and killed it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The noise of the gun so frightened the poor savage that he did not know what to do. He shook like a leaf. He thought that I was going to kill him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 420.00px; height: 250.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image15.gif" style="width: 420.00px; height: 250.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He did not see the kid I had shot. He threw himself at my feet. Although I could not understand a word he said, yet I knew that he was begging me to have pity on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And indeed I did pity him&mdash;he was so frightened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took him by the hand and lifted him up. I laughed at him and pointed to the kid that I had killed. When he saw it and understood me, he ran to fetch it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Going on through the woods, I saw a big bird sitting on a tree. I thought it was a hawk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;See there, Friday!&quot; I said, as I pointed to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Bang! went my gun. The bird fell to the ground. It was not a hawk, but a parrot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Friday was amazed. He looked at the gun and trembled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For a long time he would not touch a gun. He would look at it and talk to it. He would say, in his own language: &quot;O wonderful thing! Do not kill me! Do not kill me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We found nothing more in the woods that day. Friday carried the kid home, and I took off its skin and dressed it. Then I stewed some of the best pieces and made some good broth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At dinner I gave some of the broth to my man. He liked it very well, but he could not bear salt in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I tried to show him that food was best with a little salt. But he did not think so, and he would never eat meat that was salted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next day I set Friday to work. I had him thrash some barley for me and grind the grains into meal as I had always done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He did his work very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I let him see me make some bread and bake it. He learned very fast and soon could cook and keep house as well as any one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Little, by little I taught him how to work on my farm. We fenced another field and sowed more barley. For now there were two mouths to feed instead of one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Very soon Friday learned to talk quite well. He learned the name of everything he saw. He was very quick, and I took pleasure in teaching him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told him all about gunpowder and guns and showed him how to shoot. I gave him a knife, which pleased him not a little. I made him a belt and gave him a hatchet to carry in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told him about the countries on the other side of the great ocean. And I told him something of my own history.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Little by little I explained how my people traded in great ships, and how my own ship had been wrecked on the coast of this island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus, between working and teaching, I forgot all my fears. The days passed by, and every day brought some new delight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was the most pleasant year of my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I often asked my man Friday to tell me about his own country. He told me all that he knew, and his words made me feel quite sure that the mainland of South America was not far away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In fact, the low shore that I could see far to the west of my island was part of the coast of that great continent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Friday told me that white men sometimes went there. He said that they had long, dark beards and were always trying to trade with his people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I felt quite sure they were Spaniards, and I had a great mind to go over, if I could, and join them. Indeed, my whole mind was set on seeing some of my own people again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought that if I could only get to the mainland, I would find some way to reach England, or at least some place where Englishmen lived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I told Friday that I would give him a boat to go back to his own country. This was part of my plan for getting away from the island.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I took him over to the other side of the island and showed him my canoe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We cleared it of water and then took a short sail in it. Friday could paddle very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Now, Friday,&quot; I said, &quot;shall we paddle across the sea to your own country?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked very dull at my saying this, and I saw that he thought the canoe was too small.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I have a bigger boat. I will show it to you to-morrow.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The next morning, therefore, I took him to see the first boat I had made and which I could not get to the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He said it was big enough. But it had been lying on the ground for twenty-three years and was rotten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;We will make a new boat, Friday,&quot; I said. &quot;We will make one as big as this. Then you shall go to your old home in it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked very sad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Why are you angry with Friday?&quot; he asked. &quot;What has he done?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told him that I was not angry, and asked him what he meant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Not angry! not angry!&quot; he cried. &quot;Then why do you want to send Friday away to his old home?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Why, Friday,&quot; I said, &quot;didn&#39;t you say that you wished you were there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; said he. &quot;Friday wishes both were there, but not Friday without his master.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;But what would I do there?&quot; I asked. &quot;I could do nothing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, yes, master,&quot; he answered very quickly &quot;You could do much. You could teach wild mans to be tame, to know God, to live right. You could do much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No, Friday,&quot; I said. &quot;You shall go without me. Leave me here to live by myself as I did before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked very sad. Then all at once he ran and picked up a hatchet. He brought it and gave it to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What shall I do with this?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You take it. Kill Friday,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Indeed,&quot; I said, &quot;and why shall I do that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Then why do you send Friday away?&quot; he said &quot;Better kill than send away.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The tears stood in his eyes as he spoke. I saw that he loved me and would always stand by me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So I told him that I would never, never send him away, and that he should always stay with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You should have seen his eyes brighten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 41:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Barley -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Therefore -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Culture -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.2qdw0jr1ndh4"><span class="c15">42.

But, I must find one that was close to the water, so that we could launch the boat when it was made.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last Friday found one.

He cut off a part of it for the boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He wished to build a fire on the top of it and thus burn out the hollow part of the boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I showed him a better way, to chop it out with hatchets and chisels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In about a month it was finished. With our axes we cut and hewed the outside till it was in a very good shape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 396.00px; height: 356.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image43.gif" style="width: 396.00px; height: 356.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then we worked hard for two weeks to get the boat into the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But when she was in, how well she floated! She would have carried at least twenty men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was wonderful how well Friday could manage her. It was wonderful how fast he could paddle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Now, Friday,&quot; I said, &quot;do you think she will carry us over the sea?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, master,&quot; he said, &quot;she will carry us even in the worst wind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My next care was to make a mast and a sail, and to fit the boat with an anchor and a rudder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was easy enough to get the mast. I had Friday cut down a tall young cedar that grew near the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He shaped it and smoothed it, and made as pretty a mast as you would wish to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As for the sail, that was another thing. I had old sails, or pieces of old sails in plenty.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But they had been lying in this place and in that for six and twenty years. It would be a wonder if they were not all rotten.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After a long search I found two pieces which I thought would do. I set to work, patching and stitching.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was slow work without needles, you may be sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I had a three-cornered, ugly thing like a shoulder-of-mutton sail to be put up with a boom at its bottom part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had also a little short sprit to run up at the top of the mast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It took two months to make the sails and the rigging as I wished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I put in a rudder to steer the boat. I was a poor carpenter, and I made a pretty rough job of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Friday knew how to paddle a canoe as well as any man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But he knew nothing about a sail. He had never seen a boat steered by a rudder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We made several little voyages near the island and I taught him how to manage everything about the boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Much as I wished to go back to my own people, I could not make up my mind to try the long voyage across to the mainland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had now been on the island twenty-seven years. My man Friday had been with me about two years, and these had been the happiest of my life. I had everything to make me comfortable and happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Why should I wish to go away?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had a great longing to see my native land again, to talk with people of my own race, perhaps to visit my kindred once more. This longing I could not rid myself of, day or night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But now new thoughts came into mind. I felt that in some way I would soon escape from the island. Indeed, I was quite sure that I would not stay there another year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I cannot tell you what made me feel that way. But I seemed to know that some great change in my life was near at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yet I went on with my farming as before. I dug, I planted, I reaped, I gathered my grapes, I did everything just as though I had no such thoughts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My man Friday was the truest of helpers. He did all the heavy labor. He would not let me lift my hand if he could help it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rainy season at last came upon us, and this put an end to most of our outdoor work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We took our new boat to a safe place some distance up the little river, above the point where I had landed my rafts from the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We hauled her up to the shore at high-water mark, and there Friday dug a little dock for her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This dock was just big enough to hold her and it was just deep enough to give her water to float in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the tide was out we made a strong dam across the end of it, to keep the water out. Thus she lay high and dry on the bank of the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To keep the rain off we laid a great many branches of trees upon her till she was covered thickly with them. A thatched roof could not have protected her better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Little did I think that I should never see our boat floating upon the water again. For all that I know, she is still lying high and dry in her little waterproof dock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We were now kept indoors a great part of the time, but we kept ourselves occupied pleasantly, and the hours passed swiftly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My first duty every morning was to read several chapters from the Bible. Then I instructed Friday in some of the truths of religion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was but an awkward teacher, but I did my best and was honest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I began by asking him about the Creator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I asked him who made the sea, the hills, the woods, the ground we walked on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He told me it was one great being who lived beyond all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I confess I could not have given a better answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He said that this great being was older than the sea or the land, the moon or the stars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I said, &quot;If this being has made all things, why do not all things worship him?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He looked very grave, and with eyes full of innocence, answered, &quot;All things say O to him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus he taught me while I was trying to teach him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c26 c4">Translate words from </span><span class="c3">Chapter 42:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Chopped -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Hauled -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c26 c4">Innocence -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_13_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246756075702&amp;usg=AOvVaw0f3gEM2Wpl0UGqsRr-UTpk">43-44</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.dy0rr2fjzney"><span class="c15">43. I See a Strange Sail</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I PASS over some wonderful things that happened during my last year on the island. For I must not make this story too long.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was fast asleep in my castle one morning when Friday came running in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;O master, master!&quot; he cried, &quot;a boat, a boat!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I jumped up and went out as quickly as could. I was in such haste that I forgot to carry my gun with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked toward the sea. About three miles from the shore I saw a strange boat coming to the island. It carried a leg-of-mutton sail and was coming swiftly with the wind. &quot;Surely,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is not the kind of boat that savages sail in.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 374.00px; height: 326.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image16.gif" style="width: 374.00px; height: 326.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I saw that it was coming not from the open sea on my side of the island, but from around a point on the south shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I ran back to my castle and told Friday to stay inside and keep quiet till we could learn whether the people in the boat were friends or foes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I climbed up to my lookout on the top of the great rock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked out toward the south shore, and there I saw a ship lying at anchor. As nearly as I could guess, it was about five miles from my castle and at least three miles from the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It looked just like an English ship, and the boat was surely an English longboat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I cannot tell you how glad I was at the thought that some of my own countrymen were so near. Yet I felt strange fears, and so made up my mind to be very cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the first place, what business could an English ship have in these seas? The English had no lands in this part of the world. They would not come here to trade. There had been no storms to drive the vessel to this place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The more I thought of the matter, the more I doubted. If these people were indeed English, they must be here for no good purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By this time the boat was quite near the shore. I could see the men in it quite plainly. They looked like Englishmen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they came in the tide was at its highest, and so they ran the boat far up on the beach about half a mile from me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I now counted eleven men, and all but three were armed with swords. As soon as the boat touched the land, the most of them jumped out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I saw that the three unarmed men were prisoners. Their hands were tied behind them and they were closely guarded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they were led on shore, they seemed in great distress as though begging for their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Friday saw all this, he cried out to me, &quot;O master! the white mans do just like savage mans with their prisoners.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Why, Friday,&quot; I said, &quot;do you think they are going to eat them?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he answered, &quot; they are going to eat them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The prisoners were led far up on the beach, and I expected every moment to see them killed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But soon their guards seemed to change their minds. They talked together for a little while. Then they untied the prisoners&#39; hands and let them go where they pleased.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The seamen scattered, some going this way, some that, as though they wished to see the country. But the men who had been prisoners sat down on the ground and seemed very sad and full of despair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I thought then of the time when I had first landed on that shore&mdash;how I had no hope, and how I gave myself up for lost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I have said, the tide was at its highest when the men came on shore. They rambled around till it had flowed out and left their boat high and dry on the sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They had left two men with the boat to guard it. But the weather being very warm, these men had fallen asleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When one of them awoke and found the water far out from the boat, he began to hello for help. All the men came running and tried to drag the boat out to the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it was so heavy they could not move it. They tugged and pulled for a long time. Then I heard one of them shout: &quot;Let her alone, boys! She&#39;ll float all right when the next tide comes up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that they gave it up and all strolled out into the country again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 43:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Strolled -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tugged -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rambled -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.agyoyv51uhre"><span class="c15">44. I Make a Bold Rescue</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I KNEW that the tide would not be at its highest again before night. So I thought that I would arm myself, and, as soon as it was dark, would venture out and learn more about my strange visitors if I could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I looked at my guns and got everything ready, and then sat down to wait.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The day, as I have said, was very hot. The three men who had been prisoners still sat under a tree by the shore. But all the rest were in the woods. No doubt they would rest in some shady place until the sun went down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At about two o&#39;clock I became so uneasy that I could wait no longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Friday,&quot; I said, &quot;let us go out and see what we can do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You should have seen us as we marched out of the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I had two guns on my shoulders and Friday had three. I had on my goatskin coat and my great hat that I have told you about. At my side was a naked sword, and in my belt were two huge pistols.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I must have looked very fierce.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We went quietly down the hill, keeping ourselves hidden among the trees.

In fact, they were on the point of running away from me when I cried: &quot;Hold, gentlemen! Do not be afraid. I am a friend. I bring help.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Then, indeed,&quot; said one of them, &quot;you must have been sent from heaven; for our case is hopeless.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;All help is from heaven, sir,&quot; I said; and then I briefly told them how I had seen them brought to the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I am an Englishman,&quot; I said, &quot;and I stand ready to help you. I have one servant, and we are well armed. Tell us what is your case, and how we may serve you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Our case,&quot; said the foremost of the three men, &quot;is too long to tell you now; for our enemies are very near. I was the captain of the ship that lies at anchor offshore. Three days ago the sailors all rose against me. They made me their prisoner. They seized upon the ship, for they wanted to become pirates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;They were about to kill me; but this morning they decided to leave me on this island to die. The men who are with me, they are doomed to the same fate. One is my mate, the other a passenger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Being brought ashore here, we had no hope but to perish. For it did not seem to us that any one could live in such a desolate place.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;But where are those cruel enemies of yours?&quot; I asked. &quot;Do you know where they are gone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;They are there, sir,&quot; he said, pointing to a grove not far away. &quot;They are sleeping in the shade. If they should wake and see you with us, they would kill us all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Have they any firearms?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Only two muskets,&quot; he answered, &quot;and one of these they have left in the boat.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Then trust everything to me,&quot; I said. &quot;If they are asleep it will be easy to kill them all.

He would live and die with me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, then,&quot; said I, &quot;if you will all obey my commands, we will see what can be done.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave each one of them a musket, with powder and shot. I told them to kill as few of the ruffians as they could, and to make prisoners of them all if possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just then we heard some of them awake. In a moment three men came out of the grove and started down to the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Are these the ringleaders?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No,&quot; answered the captain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, then, let them go,&quot; I said; &quot;but if the rest escape, it will be your fault.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With a musket in his hand and a pistol in his belt, the captain started forward. I was close at his side, while Friday and the other two men went a little ahead of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The mate in his eagerness chanced to step on some dry sticks which broke with a sharp noise beneath his feet. One of the seamen, hearing this, looked out and saw us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He gave the alarm. The sleeping wretches awoke and sprang to their feet. But it was too late. Our guns were already upon them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 302.00px; height: 440.09px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.gif" style="width: 302.00px; height: 440.09px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I need not tell you of the fight. It was sharp and short.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At its close the two ruffians who had caused all this trouble were lying dead upon the ground. The three other men, who were but slightly hurt, were our prisoners. As for my little army of five, not one was so much as scratched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">While the captain and I were binding the prisoners, Friday and the mate ran to the boat and brought away the oars and the sails.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon the three men who had gone down the shore came hurrying back to see what was the matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When they saw how matters stood, they at once gave themselves up and were bound with the rest. So our victory was complete.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We now retired to the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The prisoners were led into the back part of the cave that I had first dug, and were left there with Friday as their guard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">With the captain, the mate, and the passenger, I went into my best room, where we all refreshed ourselves with such food as I had at hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We had now time to talk over the past and make plans for the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told the captain my whole history just as I have told it to you. He, in his turn, related to me the story of his voyage from England to the West Indies, and how his crew, wishing to become pirates, had seized upon the ship and made him their prisoner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;There are still twenty-six men on board,&quot; he said. &quot;They are no doubt wondering what has become of their fellows. After a while some of them will be likely to come on shore to find out what is the matter.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Let them come,&quot; I said. &quot;We will be ready for them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We therefore went down to the shore where the boat was still lying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We found in it some rum, a few biscuits, a horn of powder, and five or six pounds of sugar. This last was very welcome to me, for I had not tasted sugar for several years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All these things we carried on shore. Then we knocked a big hole in the bottom of the boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To tell the truth, I had but little hope that we would ever recover the ship. But I thought that after she had sailed away we might repair the boat. Then we could no doubt make our way to the Spanish settlements on the mainland.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">About an hour before sunset, we heard a gun fired from the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It is as I told you,&quot; said the captain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We saw a signal waving from the mast. Then several other shots were fired.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last, when there was no answer either to the signals or to the guns there was a great stir on board, and the other boat was launched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I watched them with my spyglass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As the boat neared the shore, we saw that there were ten men in her and that they were all armed with muskets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sun shone in their faces and we had a good sight of them as they came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The captain knew them all. He said that there were three very honest fellows among them who had gone into this business against their will. All the rest, however, were bad men who were ready to do any wicked deed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We now set free two of our prisoners, for they seemed to be trustworthy men and glad that matters had turned in the captain&#39;s favor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Can we trust them, Captain?&quot; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I will stand good for them,&quot; said the captain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave them each a gun. We had now seven armed men to meet the ten who were coming to the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But we kept ourselves hidden and waited to see what they would do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As soon as they reached the shore they ran to see the other boat. What was their surprise to find her stripped of everything and a hole in her bottom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They shouted, but no one answered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They fired off their muskets, making the woods ring with their echoes. But still there was no answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then they launched their boat again, and all started to the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But on the way they changed their minds. It would never do, they thought, to leave their friends on the island without so much as hunting for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They therefore rowed back to the shore. Three men were left with the boat as guards, and the rest started out into the country to seek their lost companions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We should have been glad if they had come our way, so that we might have fired on them; but this they failed to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Night was fast coming on, and they did not dare to go far from the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By and by they came back to the boat again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We feared that they had given up the search and would now return to the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sun was setting, and darkness would soon cover both land and sea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 45:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Anxious - </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Powder - </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Stir - </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.1cvqndpkcar4"><span class="c15">46. I Am Called Governor</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">BY my orders, Friday and the captain&#39;s mate hurried through the woods to the little river where I had landed so long ago with my rafts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When they had reached the place, they shouted as loudly as they could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The men who were just getting into the boat heard them. They answered, and ran along the shore toward the little river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The three who had been left in the boat also rowed around toward the same place. Near the mouth of the river, however, they came to land again, and one of them ran along the bank of the stream to meet his fellows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this moment I rushed forward with the captain, and seized the boat before the two fellows who were in it could save themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was now almost dark, and we had nothing to do but wait till the seamen came back to the shore to look for their boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon Friday and the captain&#39;s mate rejoined us, and I stood at the head of my little army, listening to the seamen as they made their way through the bushes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We could hear them calling to one another. We could hear them telling how lame and tired they were. We could hear them saying that they were in an enchanted island where there were witches and other kinds of uncanny things. All this pleased us very much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By and by they came to the shore, quite close to where we were standing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of the men whom they had left in the boat was standing with us. He was one of the honest men whom the captain had pointed out, and he had joined us very gladly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By my orders he now cried out, &quot;Tom Smith! Tom Smith!&quot; For that was the name of the leader of the company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tom Smith answered at once, &quot;Is that you, Robinson?&quot; for he knew the voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes,&quot; the other answered, &quot;and for God&#39;s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms and yield, or you will all be dead men the next minute.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;To whom must we yield?&quot; cried Tom Smith. &quot;Where are they?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Here they are,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Here&#39;s our captain at the head of a whole army of fighting men. The boatswain is dead, and Bill Fry is dead, and all the rest of us are prisoners. If you don&#39;t yield, you are lost.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;If they&#39;ll give us quarters, we&#39;ll yield,&quot; said Smith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then the captain himself spoke up. &quot;You, Smith,&quot; he said, &quot;you know my voice. If you lay down your arms at once, you shall have your lives&mdash;all but Will Atkins.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Upon this, Will Atkins cried out: &quot;For God&#39;s sake, Captain, give me quarter! What have I done? I have been no worse than the rest.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Now this was not true. For it was Will Atkins who had first laid hold of the captain, and it was he who had tied the captain&#39;s hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Nay, Will Atkins,&quot; said the captain. &quot;You know what you have done, and I can promise you nothing. You must lay down your arms and trust to the governor&#39;s mercy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">By &quot;the governor&quot; he meant me, Robinson Crusoe&mdash;for they called me governor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The upshot of the whole matter was that they all laid down their arms and begged for their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I sent three of my men to bind them with strong cords, which they did, much to my joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c23"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 290.19px; height: 387.84px;"><img alt="" src="images/image23.gif" style="width: 290.19px; height: 387.84px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After that I sent my great army of fifty &nbsp;men&mdash;which, after all, were only five besides the three who already had them in charge&mdash;to lead them to prison.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I told the captain that it would be better to put some of our prisoners in one place and some in another, as then they would be less likely to try to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He and Friday therefore took Atkins with two others who were the worst to my cave in the woods. It was a dismal place, but very safe. There the rough fellows were left with their hands and feet tied fast, and the door blocked up with a huge stone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Late as it was, I sent the rest of them to my bower. As they also were bound, and as the place was fenced in and was very strong, they were quite safe there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They were all much frightened. For they believed that the island was inhabited by Englishmen, and that the governor had really a large army. They felt that the better they behaved the safer they would be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The captain went out to talk with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;My men,&quot; he said, &quot;you all know what a great crime you have committed. You are now in the power of the governor of this island. He will send you to England. There you will be tried, and you will be hanged in chains.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At these words they turned pale and groaned. For they were but young men and had been led into this by the four or five ruffians who were the ringleaders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Now, my men,&quot; the captain went on, &quot;you know that I have always been kind to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Certainly you have,&quot; said Tom Smith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Aye, aye!&quot; cried all the rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the captain, &quot;it grieves my heart to see you in this hard case. The ship, as you know, still lies at anchor off the shore. It is still held by some of the ruffians who brought this trouble upon us. If I should persuade the governor to set you free, what say you? Would you help me retake the ship?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Aye, aye!&quot; they all cried. &quot;We would stand by you to the end, for we should then owe our lives, to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, then,&quot; said the captain, &quot;I will see what I can do. I will go and talk with the governor.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The matter was soon arranged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The captain was to choose five of those he thought would be most faithful. These were to help him retake the ship. But the rest were to stay in prison as hostages.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the five behaved themselves well, then all were to be set free. If they did not behave, then all were to be put to death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These were the governor&#39;s orders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was then agreed that the captain, with all the men he could trust, should go out to the ship. I and my man Friday were to stay on shore to watch the prisoners.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The hole in the bottom of the long boat was soon mended. Four men, with the passenger as their leader, went out in this. The captain, with five men, went out in the other boat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was after midnight when they reached the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The men on board were taken by surprise, for they thought that these were their friends who were but just then returning to the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They even threw a rope to them and helped them on board, never suspecting that anything was wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The whole business was managed well. The second mate and the carpenter, who were among the leaders in the plot, were soon overpowered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rebel captain, the worst of the crew, was asleep in his berth. He sprang up and showed fight. He shot three times at the captain&#39;s party, wounding the mate but touching no one else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The mate, wounded as he was, raised his musket and fired. The rebel captain fell to the deck with a bullet through his head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rest, seeing that they were without leaders, fell upon their knees and begged for their lives.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Thus the captain became again the master of his own ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Translate words from Chapter 46:</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Mercy -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Begged -</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c4">Authority -</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c24">Listen to </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.archive.org/download/robinson_crusoe_anew_for_children_librivox/crusoe_anew_15_baldwin.mp3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1738246756104775&amp;usg=AOvVaw2jMtyxrpEbPZJ6Bh_WDOP4">47-49</a></span></p><h2 class="c11" id="h.u6oyn0j9fz9l"><span class="c15">47. I Have a New Suit of Clothes</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c1">THE next morning I slept quite late in my hammock, for the night had been full of toil and I had had but little rest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">All at once I was awakened by the sound of a gun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Then I heard some one calling me, &quot;Governor! Governor!&quot; It was the captain&#39;s voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I hurried out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He grasped my hand and pointed to the sea. There, a little way from our beach, was the ship.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The weather being fair, the men had brought her around and anchored her near the mouth of the river.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;My dear friend,&quot; cried the captain, &quot;there is your ship! She is all yours, for we owe our lives to you. We also are yours. Everything on board of her is yours.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I was ready to sink down with surprise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For here was a large ship, at last, ready to carry me wherever I wished to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At first I could not answer him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We stood for some minutes with our arms around each other, and neither of us could speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At last I broke out, crying like a child. Then we rejoiced together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When he had talked awhile, the captain told me that he had brought me a present.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Bring up the box for the governor!&quot; he cried to his men.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They came up the hill, carrying a wooden chest. When it was put down in my castle the captain bade me open it and help myself to all that was inside it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I did so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I found first two pounds of good tobacco, then twelve pieces of beef, six pieces of pork, a bag of peas, a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two bottles of lime juice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But under these was the greatest surprise. There I found six new shirts, six neckties, two pairs of gloves, a pair of shoes, a pair of stockings, a hat, and a very good suit of clothes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I could now dress like a man again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I went about it at once. It had been so long since I had worn such clothes that I was very awkward at putting them on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But at last I came out fully dressed.
